#  Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews 

This project was my gateway into NLP. I took a hands-on approach to learn and compare different sentiment analysis techniques, starting from the ground up to understand how they work.

I progressed through three main stages:
1.  **Classical ML:** Built baselines using TF-IDF with Logistic Regression and SVM.
2.  **RNNs:** Implemented a Bi-LSTM and ran a systematic study on different word embeddings (Random, GloVe, custom Word2Vec).
3.  **Transformers:** Fine-tuned a RoBERTa model to benchmark against a state-of-the-art architecture.

All models were tested on both long-form **IMDB** reviews and short **Rotten Tomatoes** snippets.


##  Tech Stack

*   **Core:** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
*   **NLP:** Transformers (Hugging Face), Gensim, NLTK/spaCy (for tokenization)
*   **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub


##  Results & Key Insights

The final test accuracies for the primary models are summarized below, allowing for a clear comparison of their performance on each dataset.
